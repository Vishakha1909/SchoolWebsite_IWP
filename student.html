CO-SCHOLASTIC:-</font>
Apart from academics, students at VKPS can look forward to loads of fun. With a wide range of co-curricular activities and various sporting events the academic year is never boring! To build leadership skills and understand the value of teamwork, students of Classes V to XII get a unique opportunity to participate in decision-making bodies like the School Cabinet Member Body, Student Council, etc. A broad-based selection policy is in place to enable maximum participation in the various activities.

CO-CURRICULAR ACTIVITIES:-</font>
VKPS truly believes that to develop self confidence and self esteem in the children and make them ready to take on the world, extra-curricular activities have to be encouraged and every child must be motivated to participate in them.
<font color="Green" size=4>Club activities</font> are encouraged and every child has to opt for one area of specialisation. A wide spectrum of activities ranging from Yoga, Chess, Quiz, Public Speaking, Instrumental music, Vocal Music, Dance, Calligraphy and several others are offered.
